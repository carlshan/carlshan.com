<div id="home">
    <p>My name is Carl. </p>
    <p>I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn on the Economic Graph team.</p>
    <p>I was formerly a high school computer science teacher at Nueva, a school in San Mateo, CA. Before then, I was a 2016 Education Pioneers Fellow working at the national charter network Rocketship Education in Redwood City. Before that, I was a 2014 receipient of the University of Chicago's <a href="http://www.dssgfellowship.org/">Data Science for Social Good</a> Fellowship, allowing me to work under Professor <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/ghani-rayid">Rayid Ghani</a> at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in using my background and experience in machine learning, statistics and computer science to contribute to societal issues around poverty, health and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated with high honors from UC Berkeley in 2013, where I majored in Statistics with coursework in philosophy, computer science and took a number of graduate-level courses in education.
    </p>
    <p>
      I value curiosity, kindness, introspection, gratitude and play. Although I don't always succeed, I try to act in consistency with my values and stated beliefs.
