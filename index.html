  <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Carl. I'm currently a 2014 Fellow at the University of Chicago's <a href="http://dssg.io">Data Science for Social Good</a> program, working under <a href="http://rayidghani.com">Rayid Ghani</a> at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy. I am developing my statistics & computer science skills so that I can contribute to societal issues around poverty, health and education.
