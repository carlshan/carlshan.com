<div id="home">
    <p> My name is Carl. </p>
    <p> I work as a Senior Data Scientist at LinkedIn on the Economic Graph team.</p>
    <p>I was formerly a high school computer science teacher at Nueva, a school in San Mateo, CA. Before then, I was a 2016 Education Pioneers Fellow working at the national charter network Rocketship Education in Redwood City. Before that, I was a 2014 receipient of the University of Chicago's <a href="http://dssg.io">Data Science for Social Good</a> Fellowship, allowing me to work under Professor <a href="http://rayidghani.com">Rayid Ghani</a> at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy. I'm interested in using my background and experience in machine learning, statistics and computer science so that I can contribute to societal issues around poverty, health and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated with high honors from UC Berkeley in 2013, where I majored in Statistics with coursework in philosophy, computer science and took a number of graduate-level courses in education.
